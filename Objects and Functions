Primitives are all values that have one of the aforementioned data types
- numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null

Objects are all the things composred by these data types
- arrays, functions, objects, dates, wrappers

Object-oriented Programming
- Objects interacting with one another through methods and properties
- Objects used for data storage and application modules

Constructors/prototypes are object blueprints
- e.g. Person with name, birth year, job, etc.
- Objects produced by these are referred to as instances

Inheritance is when one object is based on another object
- Gets access to another's properties and methods
- Made possible by the prototype property every object has for its instances

All objects we declare are themselves inheriting from a universal Object
- i.e. every object has a set of JS methods you don't need to declare
- this is the prototype chain: Object -> objects -> instances
  - the universal Object points to null, ending the chain

** Summary **
Every JS object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JS
The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other instances to inherit
When a certain property or method is called, the search starts in that instance and moves up its prototype chain

** Coding **

Function constructors should always be capitalized

The new operator creates an empty object, then the function is called to assign properties by executing within its own execution context with the this pointer

var Person = function(name, yearOfBirth, job) {
    this.name = name;
    this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
    this.job = job;
}

Person.prototype.calculateAge = function () {
    console.log( 2016 - this.yearOfBirth);
}

var john = new Person('John', 1990, 'Teacher');
var jane = new Person ('Jane', 1969, 'Designer');
var mark = new Person('Mark', 1948, 'Retired');

john.calculateAge();
jane.calculateAge();
mark.calculateAge();

** Prototype Chain in the Console **
Inspecting an object in the console allows you to see prototypes it inherits

You should be able to prove instance.__proto__ === Object.prototype

** Object.create method **

The difference between this and the function constructor pattern is that the object.create builds an object that inherits directly from the object that is passed to it, while the constructor creates instances that inherit from its prototype property

var personProto = {
    calculateAge: function () {
        console.log(2016 - this.yearOfBirth);
    }
};

var john = Object.create(personProto);
john.name = 'Name';
john.yearOfBirth = 1990;
john.job = 'teacher';

var jane = Object.creat(personProto, {
    name: {value: 'Jane'},
    yearOfBirth: {value: 1969},
    job: {value: 'designer'}
});

** Primitives vs Objects **

Difference is that variables containing primitives store the data within the variable itself
- Variables associated with objects do not actually contain the object, they contain a reference to where the data sits

var age = 27;
var obj = {
    name: 'Jonas',
    city: 'Lisbon'
};

function change(a,b) {
    a = 30;
    b.city = 'San Francisco';
};

change(age,obj);

console.log(age);
console.log(obj.city);

** Passing Functions as Arguments **

A function is an instance of the object type
- Behaves like an object, can be stored in a variable
- Functions can return other functions

You don't need parentheses when you pass a function as an argument because it'll get called within the body of the other function
- For function prototypes, arr is Array, fn is function, el is element

var years = [1990,1965,1937,2005,1998];

function arrayCalc(arr, fn) {
    var arrResult = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arrResult.push(fn(arr[i]));
    }
    
    return arrResult;
}

function calculateAge(el) {
    return 2016 - el;
}

function isFullAge(el) {
    return el >= 18;
}

function maxHeartRate(el) {
    if (el >= 18 && el =< 81){
        return Math.round(206.9 - (0.67 * el));
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}


var ages = arrayCalc(years, calculateAge);
var fullAges = arrayCalc(ages,isFullAge);
var rates = arrayCalc(ages, maxHeartRate);

console.log(ages);
console.log(rates);

** First Class Functions **
You can use double sets of parentheses for functions that return functions

function interviewQuestion(job) {
    if (job === 'designer') {
        return function(name) {
            console.log(name + ', can you please explain what UX design is?');
        }
    } else if(job === 'teacher') {
        return function (name) {
            console.log('What subject do you teach, ' + name + '?');
        }
    } else {
        return function(name) {
            console.log('Hello' + name + ', what do you do?');
        }
    }
}

var teacherQuestion = interviewQuestion('teacher');
var designerQuestion = interviewQuestion('designer');

teacherQuestion('John');
designerQuestion('John');

interviewQuestion('teacher')('Mark');

** Immediately Invoked Function Expressions **
Tricks the parser into thinking a declaration is an expression
- What's inside of parenthesis cannot be a statement
- Parameters that get passed go in the second second of parentheses as well

(function (goodLuck) {
        var score = Math.random() * 10;
    console.log(score >= 5 - goodLuck);
})(5);

** Closure **
An inner function always has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has return.
