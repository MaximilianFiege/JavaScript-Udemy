Comments are the same as in C++

Type coercion means that JS converts variables if you want to combine them.
- firstName + age returns a string that includes the age converted to a string
- Booleans convert to the words true or false as strings

Declare multiple variables with a comma after the initial declaration
- Make sure to define after

Variable mutation is redefining a variable with another data type
- i.e. 28 to twenty-eight

alert() has a dialogue box pop up

prompt() has an input field
- String inside the brackets is the question accompanying the prompt
- var lastName = prompt('What is his last name?')
