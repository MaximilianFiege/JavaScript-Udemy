Falsy values are determined false in an if/else statement 
- Either undefined, null, 0, '', NaN

Truthy values are the opposite
- Subset comprised of all NOT falsy values

Good way to test if a value has been defined.
- Make sure to account for 0 being mistakenly labeled as unidentified with an OR statement.
