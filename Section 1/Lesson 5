Javascript is lightweight, cross-platform, and object-oriented

JS is one of three core technologies of web development
- Beside HTML and CSS
- HTML is content (nouns), CSS is presentation (adjective), JS is for interactivity (verb)

JS was traditionally only for web pages (i.e. client-side) but node.js allows for server-side functionality

React and Angular are frameworks/libraries built on JS
