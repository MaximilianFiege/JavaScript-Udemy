Operator precedence goes from 0 to 20, with 20 being the best
- Parenthese are 20
- Mathematical Operations take precedence over logical operators
- assignment operator is one of the lowest in precedence

Associativity is the direction in which an operator goes
- Assignment operator is right to left

**1st Coding Challenge**

var markHeight, markMass,johnHeight, johnMass;
markHeight = 1.65;
markMass = 60;
johnHeight = 1.97;
johnMass = 95;

var markBMI = markMass / (markHeight^2);
var johnBMI = johnMass / (johnHeight^2);

var markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;

console.log("Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? " + markHigherBMI);
console.log(markBMI);
console.log(johnBMI);
