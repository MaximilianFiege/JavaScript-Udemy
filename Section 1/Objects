//Object Literal
Objects are like arrays, but position doesn't matter.
- Defined with curly brackets
- Key:Value pairs
- Can hold another object or array within itself

You can call an object element like you would an array, but via the key
- john['lastName']
- call has to be akin to the data type (put string keys in quotes)

//New Object
Can declare new object like an array i.e. new Jane();
